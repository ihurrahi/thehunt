# The Hunt
Scavenger hunt/escape room game created for my wedding

I created this as a form of entertainment for the guests at my wedding. It opened up midway through the reception and had puzzles and riddles to solve, sometimes requiring them to explore the venue to find clues.

Frontend was written with plain HTML, CSS and Javascript, with the [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) library for some animations.

Backend API was written with Python and Flask. It is hosted on my personal website, [https://thinkingalaud.com](https://thinkingalaud.com), which just serves some static files through Nginx.
